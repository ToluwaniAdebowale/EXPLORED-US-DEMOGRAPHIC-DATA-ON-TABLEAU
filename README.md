# EXPLORED-US-DEMOGRAPHIC-DATA-ON-TABLEAU
https://public.tableau.com/profile/glory6973#!/vizhome/scaassignment/DataonUSA?publish=yes<br>
The link above is to the worksheet where I explored US demographic data using tableau<br>
I tried to answer the following questions:<br>
What is the total Population of America by State?<br>
What is the population of women against men in each state?<br>
How does poverty look across America?<br>
<br>
Also, I created a story using my findings
